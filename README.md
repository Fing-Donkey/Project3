# Project3
Project 3 code
So this is 2 assignments in one project, where we had to implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes and use it to find all prime numbers less than or equal to one million. \
Use the result to prove Goldbach's Conjecture for all even integers between four and one million, inclusive.
